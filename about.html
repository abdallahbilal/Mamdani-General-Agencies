      <h2 class="WhoWeAre">Our Story<h2>
<img class="Aboutimage1" src="images/download6.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="Paragraph">The company was established in 1979 as a sole proprietorship
  by Mr. Mohamed Bashir who is a qualified Chartered accountant
  and has an extensive amount of experience in major business
  lines like Manufacturing, Clearing & Forwarding, and Trading to
  mention a few the main aim was to bridge the gap between
  companies and individual handyman. We saw the need to
  bring professionalism to this profession. Earlier we would
  get many contracts and we would work on them successfully
  and keep all our clients happy but we could not tender for
  bigger contracts so we decided to raise our bar by giving
  birth to Mamdani General Agencies.
